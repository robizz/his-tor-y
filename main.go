// TODO:
// probably the generate file list should go in the extract package and be a deeper module...
// also the nodes structure make the package parse dumb as a name mmmm
/*
packages proposal:
- command
- download
- extract
- parse
- transform
- output
*/

// related to commands: I need:
// - a way to define a command interface with related inputs and outputs
// - a way to inject specific flags to specific commands
// - a way to define a strategy pattern kinda of approach to know which command to instantiate or launch

// command line options to tune the resolution of the compaction
// when treating multiple days, duplicates management needs to be managed.
// a final cleanup of all text files must be done
// are we sure we want to use pointers for exit nodes? for now we have values, maybe a memory footprint and performance instrumentation with a full year of data would be nice
// When program reaches the desired complexity and tests are in place, apply effective go / practical go / bill kennedy refactoring
// clean comments
// variable names are ugly
// create a cache and allow commands to run in the cache (maybe using a bolt db? an embedded database? an in memory struct?)
// the in memory struct could be also a zipped json or array of zipped items of a struct that you decompress on the fly, perf it would be nice.
// command should be silent to use pipe or output redirect. errors should be on stderr
// errors should be constant errors like dave cheney suggests
// we need an integration test to test the whole flow
// Main functionality is: I give you the list of nodes that were found for the time range with the last update inside the time range.
// another funtionality is "IP History":I give you an IP and a parameter like "days", the tool gives me 0 with formatted list of nodes and dates.
// generate go doc
//
// goroutines for multiple download
// new command
// output management
//
// END TODO
